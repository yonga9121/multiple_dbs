Description:
    You must use this generator to start using the multiple_dbs gem .
    It creates the files needed to work with your databases.
      Those files are:
      - An initializer that define a constant with the databases names that you
        give as an argument and the constants that store the databases configuration.
      - the DBNAME_database.yml configuration files for each one of the databases.
      - the database.yml. This file is needed by rails as default.
    You can pass as options the configuration for each environment
    (development, production, test).

Example:
    rails generate multiple_dbs_initializer your_database your_database2 your_database3

    This will create and override if exist the following files:
        config/initializers/multiple_dbs_initializer.rb
        config/multiple_dbs/your_database_database.yml
        config/multiple_dbs/your_database2_database.yml
        config/multiple_dbs/your_database3_database.yml
        config/database.yml

Example with Options:
    rails generate multiple_dbs_initializer your_database your_database2 your_database3 --development=username:super password:cool --test=adapter:mysql2 pool:2 --production=username:imsecure
